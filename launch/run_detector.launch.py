"""
Single, growing launch file for the whole onboard_detector_v2 pipeline —
mirrors onboard_detector/launch/run_detector.launch.py's role (the "launch
everything" file, as opposed to run_calibration_icp.launch.py and
run_yolo.launch.py, which each stay their own standalone file for
tuning/testing in isolation, with their own rviz).

Do NOT add a new run_<phase>.launch.py per phase — extend this one instead,
the same way onboard_detector's run_detector.launch.py grew a node at a
time (detector_node, then static_structures_node, then yolo_node, ...). Today
it launches one calibration_icp_node PER CAMERA (see calibration_nodes
below) + preprocessing_node + static_structures_node (standalone, asynchronous
wall/floor detector — see src/static_structures_node.cpp's own header) + one
yolo_seg_track_detector PER CAMERA too (see detection_nodes below and
scripts/yolo_seg_track_detector.py's own header — one OS process per
camera, for real parallelism, same reasoning as calibration_nodes) — for
whichever detection model(s) enable_yolo11/enable_yolo26 turn on (see
those args and cfg/<env>/detection_yolo26.yaml: same node/script, just a
different cfg file/node-name/topic prefix per model, so trying a new
checkpoint is a new cfg/<env>/detection_<model>.yaml + one more entry in
detection_models below, not a new node script) + one
yolo_semantic_seg_detector PER CAMERA (see semantic_seg_nodes below and
scripts/yolo_semantic_seg_detector.py's own header — a separate model/task,
semantic not instance segmentation, gated by its own enable_semantic_segmentation
arg); when the
tracking+classification phase exists, add its Node(...) entry and
config lookup here too, following the calibration/preprocessing entries
below as the template (ParameterFile from
cfg/<env>/<node>.yaml, use_sim_time, output='screen').

    # PER CAMERA — same pattern as calibration_nodes above, and for the same
    # reason: real parallelism. A single instance handling every camera
    # (the original design) shares one Python process/GIL and one
    # timer_period_sec budget across all of them, processed strictly in
    # turn — with 2 cameras at ~15.5ms of actual work each, that ate ~31ms
    # of the 33ms tick and measurably dropped ~20% of incoming frames
    # (measured: 30Hz camera in, ~24Hz detections out). Splitting into one
    # OS process per camera removes the GIL/shared-timer contention
    # entirely: each camera gets its own full 33ms budget and its own
    # CUDA context, so both can approach the input rate independently.
    # yolo_seg_track_detector.py itself needed NO changes for this — its
